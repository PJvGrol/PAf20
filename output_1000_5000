Which performance improvements? 0 for none, 1 for preprocessing, 2 for postprocessing, 3 for both
Select the frequency of postprocessing, where 1 means every round, 2 every 2 rounds etc.
How many vertices on the left side of the bipartite graph?
How many vertices on the right side of the bipartite graph?
How many edges per vertex on average?
How many processors do you want to use?
-------------------------------------------------------
Primary job  terminated normally, but 1 process returned
a non-zero exit code. Per user-direction, the job has been aborted.
-------------------------------------------------------
2 total processes killed (some possibly by mpirun during cleanup)
