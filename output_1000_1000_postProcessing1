How many vertices on the left side of the bipartite graph?
How many vertices on the right side of the bipartite graph?
How many edges per vertex on average?
How many processors do you want to use?
In round 1 a total of 1089 augmenting paths were found of length 2
Of these paths 936 were accepted and therefore 153 rejected
In round 1, 1089 augmenting paths were found, resulting in 936 new matchings
DONE!
