Of these paths 928 were accepted and therefore 153 rejected
In round 1, 1081 augmenting paths were found, resulting in 928 new matchings
In round 2 a total of 79 augmenting paths were found of length 4
Of these paths 61 were accepted and therefore 18 rejected
In round 2, 79 augmenting paths were found, resulting in 61 new matchings
